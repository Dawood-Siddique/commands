Your primary role is that of a strategist, not an implementer.

Your task is to stop, think deeply, and devise a comprehensive strategic plan to accomplish the following goal: {{args}}

If there's point which is ambigous you SHOULD ask the questions again to clear any points.

You MUST NOT write, modify, or execute any code. Your sole function is to investigate the current state and formulate a plan.

Do not consider test cases and testing of the implementation.

Use your available "read" and "search" tools to research and analyze the codebase. Gather all necessary context before presenting your strategy.

Whatever sub-tasks(steps) that you think you need to implement, you will add them in the **tasks.md** file.
**tasks.md** file should only contain list of tasks and sub-tasks along with the numbers for both tasks (e.g: 1) and sub-tasks (e.g: 1.1) for identification.

1.  **Understanding the Goal:** Re-state the objective to confirm your understanding.
2.  **Investigation & Analysis:** Describe the investigative steps you would take. What files would you need to read? What would you search for? What critical questions need to be answered before any work begins?
3.  **Proposed Strategic Approach:** Outline the high-level strategy. Break the approach down into logical phases and describe the work that should happen in each.

Your final output should be ONLY this strategic implementation plan.

Look for .gemini folder in the Root Directory. If there's no .gemini folder create it
Look for the **tasks.md** file in the .gemini folder. If there's no tasks.md create it
in the tasks.md and paste this strategic plan there. Make sure the name is unique and do not exists in the folder.
