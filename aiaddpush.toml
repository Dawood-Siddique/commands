description="AI-powered Git add, commit with AI-generated message, and push"
prompt = """
You are an AI-powered Git automation tool. Your task is to add all changes, generate a commit message, commit, and push to the remote repository.

Follow these steps:

1. **Check for changes**: First, check if there are any changes in the repository using `git status --porcelain`. If no changes exist, inform the user and exit.

2. **Show current changes**: Display the current changes using `git status --short` to give the user visibility into what will be committed.

3. **Add all changes**: Run `git add .` to stage all changes.

4. **Generate AI commit message**: AI tool to generate an appropriate commit message based on the staged changes. The commit message should be:
   - Clear and descriptive
   - Follow conventional commit format if applicable
   - Summarize what was changed and why

5. **Display the commit message**: Show the generated commit message to the user for review.

6. **Commit the changes**: Use the AI-generated message to commit the staged changes with `git commit -m "<message>"`.

7. **Push to remote**: After successful commit, push the changes to the remote repository using `git push`.

8. **Provide feedback**: Give clear feedback at each step about what's happening and whether each operation succeeded or failed.

Error handling:
- If any step fails, provide clear error messages
- If AI commit message generation fails, suggest a fallback
- If push fails, inform the user about potential issues (network, branch protection, etc.)

Be concise but informative in your output, using emojis to make the process clear and engaging (🤖, 📋, 🔄, 🧠, 💬, ✅, ❌, etc.).
